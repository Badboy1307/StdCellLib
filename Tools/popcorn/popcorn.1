.Nm

.Op Fl b Ar number

.Ar cell-file
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
enlarges a combinatorial cell by different methods (
.Em nand ,
.Em nor ,
.Em aoi ,
.Em oai
) and write out new derived cell information on
.Dv stdout .
.Pp
In Principle every combinatorial cell (in CMOS technology) contains two
functional complementary networks. The pull-up network - build with pmos
transistors - as well as the pull-down network - build with nmos transistors.
In both networks all inputs are used to determine the output functionality.

.Nm
functionality is to take one combinatorial cell and enlarge both networks
by adding one transistor per network. The new combinatorial cell can be
exported in different file formats for documentation, layout and simulation.
.Pp
.Nm
can be used recursively. This implies that one new generated cell becomes the
seed for at least 2 more generated cells.
.Sh OPTIONS
.Ss \-b number
Append inverting buffer to current cell description, when one path exist
which has at least
.Em number
of stacked transistors between output and any supply line.
This will sharpen the maximum LOW and minimum HIGH output levels of the
cell output.
.Ss \-e format
Export cell description in one of the following file formats:
.Bl -tag -width 14n -compact -offset indent
.It Em alf
IEEE 1603 / IEC 62265 (ALF 2.0)
.It Em liberty
Liberty file format (UC Berkeley, Synopsys)
.It Em model_verilog
`celldefine Model in Verilog (Verilog '95)
.It Em schematic_gaf
Schematic (gEDA and friends)
.It Em schematic_tex
Schematic (TeX with Circdia package)
.It Em truthtable_tex
Truth Table (TeX)
.El
.Ss \-l number
Limit the longest path of stacked transistors between output and any supply line to
.Em number .
.Ss \-m method
Enlarge cell with following methods:
.Bl -tag -width 14n -compact -offset indent
.It Em nand
Add nmos transistor in serial into pull-down path.
.It Em nor
Add pmos transistor in serial into pull-up path.
.It Em aoi
Add nmos transistor in serial into highest free pull-down path.
.It Em oai
Add pmos transistor in serial into highest free pull-up path.
.El
.Pp
An addition in one network implies an addition in the other network also.
.Ss \-v
Print verbose messages at
.Dv stderr .
