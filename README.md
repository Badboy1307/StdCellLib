# StdCellLib

This Repository contains all Sources for LibreSilicons's Standard Cell Library.
Started once as manual work, given slow progress, the focus was shifted to the Standard Cell Generator which was named Popcorn.
Many Sources are now generated by Popcorn and still Work-in-Progress.
Check regulary for updates.

And please, do not hesitate to contact the Authors of Standard Cell Library for Patches, Feature additions or Questions.
Any feedback welcome under [Email](mailto://stdcelllib@nospam.chipforge.org "stdcelllib@nospam.chipforge.org").

## Requirements

On Debian based system you can install most of the requirements with
```
apt-get install make guile texlive-latex-extra texlive-extra-utils  texlive-latex-recommended 
```
Additionally for drawings with LaTeX you need http://www.taylorgruppe.de/circdia/ , download and unzip it, then run mktexlsr in the directory.

Other software for the Popcorn tool which should be installed before usage, is
